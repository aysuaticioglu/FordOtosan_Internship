Freespace Segmentation with Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN)

* What is Machine Learning?

It is a branch of artifical intelligence where computer systems learn and perform tasks by analyzing data and using their experiences.Machine learning algorithms and statistical models are used to analysze data,discover patterns,relationships and extract meaningful information.

* What is Unsupervised vs Supervised learning difference?

The main difference is whether the training data has labels or not. In supervised learning, the data includes inputs and corresponding labels. In unsupervised learning, the data is unlabeled, and the focus is on discovering structures and patterns within the data.

* What is Deep Learning?

It is a subfield of machine learning that uses mathematical models called artificial neural networks to perform complex tasks.Deep learning methods automatically learn and interpret complex structures in data by leveraging datasets.

* What is Neural Network (NN)?

It's a mathematical model that imitates the structure of the human brain. It uses interconnected artificial neurons to handle input data and generate outputs. Neural networks are widely used in machine learning.

* What is Convolution Neural Network (CNN)? Please give 2 advantages over NN.

It is a special kind of neural network made for working with structured data,particularly images.CNNs are widely used in deep learning for tasks like sorting images into categories,recognizing objeects and dividing images into parts.CNNs have two benefits over regular neural networks:they can automatically learn important features from the data and they share parameters between different parts of the network which make them more efficient.

* What is segmentation task in NN? Is it supervised or unsupervised?

The segmentation task involves identifying and delineating different objects or regions within data,typically images.It usally requires labeled data, making it a supervised task.

* What is classification task in NN? Is it supervised or unsupervised?

The classification task assigns input data to specific categories or classes.It is also a supervised task that requires labeled data with inputs and corresponding target classes.

* Compare segmentation and classification in NN.

Segmentation focuses on identifying regions or objects within data, while classification assigns data to predefined classes or categories. Segmentation is more detailed and deals with complex data structures, while classification is a more general task with simpler output.

* What is data and dataset difference?

Data refers to any information or observations, while a dataset is a collection of organized data specifically used for training or evaluating machine learning models.
  
* What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in terms of dataset?

In supervised learning, the dataset contains labeled data with inputs and corresponding labels. In unsupervised learning, the dataset consists of unlabeled data, and the algorithms aim to find patterns or structures within the data without predefined labels.

* Data Preprocessing


  Extracting Masks


* What is color space ?

Color space refers to specific way of representing colors in a mathematical or visual model.It defines the range of colors that can be displayed or captured and provides a standardized system for encoding and interpreting colors.

* What RGB stands for ?

RGB stands for Red,Green and Blue.It is an additive color model in which colors are created by combining different intensities of red,green and blue prmary colors.RGB is widely useed in digital imaging and displays.


* In Python, can we transform from one color space to another?

Yes,in Python,we can transform images from one color space to another using various libraries and functions.Libraries like OpenCv an PIL(Python Imaging Library) provide functions and methods to convert between diffrent color spaces,such as RGB,HSV,CMYK and more.


* What is the popular library for image processing?

 One popular library for image processing in Python is OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library). OpenCV provides a wide range of functions and algorithms for image manipulation, transformation, feature extraction, object detection, and more. It is widely used in computer vision and image processing applications.
